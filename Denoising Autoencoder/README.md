# Denoising Autoencoder:
An autoencoder is a neural network used for dimensionality reduction; that is, for feature selection and extraction. Autoencoders with more hidden layers than inputs run the risk of learning the identity function – where the output simply equals the input – thereby becoming useless.

# The Implementation
- Collect numerical number images dataset from MNIST.
- Implement two models: ANN and CNN for same data set. 
- Finally, remove the noise from the images/ picture.
- Compare the ANN and CNN model performance with accuracy measurement.
