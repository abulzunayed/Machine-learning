# Denoising Autoencoder:
An autoencoder is a neural network used for dimensionality reduction; that is, for feature selection and extraction. Denoising autoencoders attempt to address identity-function risk by randomly corrupting input (i.e. introducing noise) that the autoencoder must then reconstruct, or denoise. Here, Two kinds of noise were introduced to the standard MNIST dataset: Gaussian and speckle, to help generalization for denoising.

# The Implementation
- Collect numerical number images dataset from MNIST.
- Implement two models: ANN and CNN for same data set. 
- Finally, remove the noise from the images/ picture.
- Compare the ANN and CNN model performance with accuracy measurement.
