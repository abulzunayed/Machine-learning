# 2. Classification:
I implemented classification tasks including decision Tree, K_NN, K_mean, Logistic regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and SVM using Numpy and Pandas.
# 3. Regression: 
I implemented Regression tasks including Linear regression, multiple linear regression, polynomial regression, support vector regression, and Data processing using Numpy and Pandas including examples.
# 4. Deep Learning:
My coding practices Deep learning ANN and CNN tasks including Tensorflow, Keras, scikit learn, Scipy.
