**(Project-2) Generating Faces with Deep Convolution Generative adversarial network(DCGAN)**
Implementation of DCGAN on celebA dataset to generate faces using Large Scale Celebrates Face Images(200K celebrity images). Thus, the depth is 3 (RGB â€” 3 color channels).

**(Project-3) Generative adversarial network(GAN) using MNIST handwritten dataset**
The MNIST database is a dataset of handwritten digits. It has 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples. Each image is represented by 28x28 pixels, each containing a value 0 - 255 with its grayscale value.
