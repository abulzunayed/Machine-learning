**(Project-2) Generating Faces with Deep Convolution Generative adversarial network(DCGAN)**
Implementation of DCGAN on celebA dataset to generate faces using Large Scale Celebrates Face Images(200K celebrity images). Thus, the depth is 3 (RGB â€” 3 color channels).

**(Project-3) Generative adversarial network(GAN) using MNIST handwritten dataset**
The MNIST database is a dataset of handwritten digits. It has 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples. Each image is represented by 28x28 pixels, each containing a value 0 - 255 with its grayscale value.

# 2. Classification:
I implemented classification tasks including decision Tree, K_NN, K_mean, Logistic regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and SVM using Numpy and Pandas.
  - Dogs and cats image classification.
  - CIFAR-10 image classification.
# 3. Regression: 
I implemented Regression tasks including Linear regression, multiple linear regression, polynomial regression, support vector regression, and Data processing using Numpy and Pandas including examples.
# 4. Deep Learning:
My coding practices Deep learning ANN and CNN tasks include Tensorflow, Keras, Scikit Learn, and Scipy.
